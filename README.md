Is this you?

* You like having lossless audio on your iPhone but don't want to subscribe to Tidal.
* You can't sync your music library because you're an Apple Music subscriber.
* You keep a stupid amount of ALAC files in your iTunes library.
* You're going to manually move over those files to a separate music player app (like [VOX](https://vox.rocks/iphone-music-player)) so you can still use those lossless files.
* You want an app that's going to keep a record of what you've already copied over and highlight what hasn't.
* You've made some bad decisions that led to this point.

Then this is the repo for you!
